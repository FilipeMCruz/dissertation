  abstract  = {Publish/subscribe is a distributed interaction paradigm well adapted to the deployment of scalable and loosely coupled systems.Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ are two popular open-source and commercially-supported pub/sub systems that have been around for almost a decade and have seen wide adoption. Given the popularity of these two systems and the fact that both are branded as pub/sub systems, two frequently asked questions in the relevant online forums are: how do they compare against each other and which one to use?In this paper, we frame the arguments in a holistic approach by establishing a common comparison framework based on the core functionalities of pub/sub systems. Using this framework, we then venture into a qualitative and quantitative (i.e. empirical) comparison of the common features of the two systems. Additionally, we also highlight the distinct features that each of these systems has. After enumerating a set of use cases that are best suited for RabbitMQ or Kafka, we try to guide the reader through a determination table to choose the best architecture given his/her particular set of requirements.},

  abstract  = {In this work, we propose a method for extending Node-RED to allow the automatic decomposition and partitioning of the system towards higher decentralization. We provide a custom firmware for constrained devices to expose their resources, as well as new nodes and modifications in the Node-RED engine that allow automatic orchestration of tasks. The firmware is responsible for low-level management of health and capabilities, as well as executing MicroPython scripts on demand. Node-RED then takes advantage of this firmware by (1)&nbsp;providing a device registry allowing devices to announce themselves, (2) generating MicroPython code from dynamic analysis of flow and nodes, and (3) automatically (re-)assigning nodes to devices based on pre-specified properties and priorities. A mechanism to automatically detect abnormal run-time conditions and provide dynamic self-adaptation was also explored. Our solution was tested using synthetic home automation scenarios, where several experiments were conducted with both virtual and physical devices. We then exhaustively measured each scenario to allow further understanding of our proposal and how it impacts the system’s resiliency, efficiency, and elasticity.},

  abstract   = {Well adapted to the loosely coupled nature of distributed interaction in large-scale applications, the publish/subscribe communication paradigm has recently received increasing attention. With systems based on the publish/subscribe interaction scheme, subscribers register their interest in an event, or a pattern of events, and are subsequently asynchronously notified of events generated by publishers. Many variants of the paradigm have recently been proposed, each variant being specifically adapted to some given application or network model. This paper factors out the common denominator underlying these variants: full decoupling of the communicating entities in time, space, and synchronization. We use these three decoupling dimensions to better identify commonalities and divergences with traditional interaction paradigms. The many variations on the theme of publish/subscribe are classified and synthesized. In particular, their respective benefits and shortcomings are discussed both in terms of interfaces and implementations.},

@article{BIBRI2018230,
  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key components of the ICT infrastructure of smart sustainable cities as an emerging urban development approach due to its great potential to advance environmental sustainability. As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications.},

  abstract = {The technology and healthcare industries have been deeply intertwined for quite some time. New opportunities, however, are now arising as a result of fast-paced expansion in the areas of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data. In addition, as people across the globe have begun to adopt wearable biosensors, new applications for individualized eHealth and mHealth technologies have emerged. The upsides of these technologies are clear: they are highly available, easily accessible, and simple to personalize; additionally they make it easy for providers to deliver individualized content cost-effectively, at scale. At the same time, a number of hurdles currently stand in the way of truly reliable, adaptive, safe and efficient personal healthcare devices. Major technological milestones will need to be reached in order to address and overcome those hurdles; and that will require closer collaboration between hardware and software developers and medical personnel such as physicians, nurses, and healthcare workers. The purpose of this special issue is to analyze the top concerns in IoT technologies that pertain to smart sensors for health care applications; particularly applications targeted at individualized tele-health interventions with the goal of enabling healthier ways of life. These applications include wearable and body sensors, advanced pervasive healthcare systems, and the Big Data analytics required to inform these devices.},

  abstract = {The scarcity of clean water resources around the globe has generated a need for their optimum utilization. Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, based on the application specific sensors' data acquisition and intelligent processing, are bridging the gaps between the cyber and physical worlds. IoT based smart irrigation management systems can help in achieving optimum water-resource utilization in the precision farming landscape. This paper presents an open-source technology based smart system to predict the irrigation requirements of a field using the sensing of ground parameter like soil moisture, soil temperature, and environmental conditions along with the weather forecast data from the Internet. The sensing nodes, involved in the ground and environmental sensing, consider soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature, Ultraviolet (UV) light radiation, and relative humidity of the crop field. The intelligence of the proposed system is based on a smart algorithm, which considers sensed data along with the weather forecast parameters like precipitation, air temperature, humidity, and UV for the near future. The complete system has been developed and deployed on a pilot scale, where the sensor node data is wirelessly collected over the cloud using web-services and a web-based information visualization and decision support system provides the real-time information insights based on the analysis of sensors data and weather forecast data. The system has a provision for a closed-loop control of the water supply to realize a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. The paper describes the system and discusses in detail the information processing results of three weeks data based on the proposed algorithm. The system is fully functional and the prediction results are very encouraging.},

  abstract  = {Visions of smart homes have long caught the attention of researchers and considerable effort has been put toward enabling home automation. However, these technologies have not been widely adopted despite being available for over three decades. To gain insight into this state of affairs, we conducted semi-structured home visits to 14 households with home automation. The long term experience, both positive and negative, of the households we interviewed illustrates four barriers that need to be addressed before home automation becomes amenable to broader adoption. These barriers are high cost of ownership, inflexibility, poor manageability, and difficulty achieving security. Our findings also provide several directions for further research, which include eliminating the need for structural changes for installing home automation, providing users with simple security primitives that they can confidently configure, and enabling composition of home devices.},

@article{KOO20224191,
  abstract = {Many standards, projects, and platforms are being developed as the Internet of Things (IoT) is adopted in a wide range of fields. However, because each IoT platform is based on a different resource identifier (ID), it is difficult to identify each device and use the service among heterogeneous IoT platforms. To solve this problem, we propose an interoperability framework that includes an IoT resource name system (RNS) based on analysis of the resource IDs (i.e., device ID and resource request formats) of five selected IoT platforms: oneM2M, Oliot, Watson IoT, IoTivity, and FIWARE. The IoT RNS converts a specific resource path into a resource request format for each platform. The converted resource path is shared among IoT RNSs for each platform, and users can request services from other platforms using converted resource paths. We also present an example of interoperability scenario among heterogeneous IoT platforms using the proposed IoT RNS in a smart city. The scenario includes each stage, such as resource registration and deletion, sharing mapping tables, converting resource addresses, and service requests. Furthermore, to prove the aims of the proposed approach, we implemented the resource interoperability scenario between oneM2M and FIWARE. In the experiments, resources can interwork in the two platforms through resource path conversion. Based on the results, we performed a qualitative evaluation of the IoT RNS with the current studies. In conclusion, our proposal overcomes the issues of building an existing integrated platform or specific central ontology and duplicating resources inside the platform. In addition, we separate the functions of the root and local IoT RNSs to solve communication traffic and memory capability issues.},

A typical system comprises the publisher, the subscriber, and the broker but, may also feature message queues, databases, clusters, or federations of brokers, apply message delivery policies, communication protocols, security services, and a streaming API. Not all these features are supported by all systems or, others may be optional. As a result, there is no common ground for the comparison of Publish-Subscribe systems. This paper presents a critical survey and taxonomy of Publish-Subscribe systems, of their design features and technologies. The concepts of message queuing, publish-subscribe systems, and publish-subscribe protocols for the cloud and the IoT are discussed and clarified. The respective evaluation is about seven state-of-the-art open-source systems namely, Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Orion-LD, Scorpio, Stellio, Pushpin, and Faye. For the sake of fair comparison, a minimum set of common features is identified in all systems. All systems are evaluated and compared in terms of functionality and performance under real-case scenarios.},

  abstract = {The development of IoT techniques and the automation enabled by trigger-action platforms have brought great convenience to human life. However, with time the proliferating IoT devices will eventually overwhelm such platforms. Specifically, the ever-increasing huge amount of linkage rules significantly challenge the response rate as well as the efficiency of conflict rule detection, which will lead to terrible user experience and disastrous security issues. In this work, we develop a rule engine system for large-scale trigger-action applications. The key insight is that the linkage rules can be executed independent from the central cloud platform, which only require edge-side gateways and an efficient addressing strategy. The platform-side maintains an global image consisting of mappings between rules and gateway addresses, while edge-side rule engine is designed based on an open source tool, i.e., Drools. The implemented RETE algorithm helps to carry out large-scale linkage rules. In addition, we design a lightweight yet effective conflict detection algorithm that categorizes those rules into several types to downgrade the computation complexity. Experiments prove that the system can reduce the resource consumption of the platform-side and remarkably enhance the response speed. Moreover, our system also achieve a high efficacy when detecting conflicts.},

IoT platforms have the potential to reduce complexity, cost, and length of product development by providing and supporting many common core system functions in a professional and presumably trustworthy manner. In principle, their use should enable IoT system designers to focus on their areas of expertise and the product's unique added value and to rely on IoT platforms to complete much of the rest of the system needed for a complete system offering [1].},

  abstract = {The rapid development and implementation of smart and IoT (Internet of Things) based technologies have allowed for various possibilities in technological advancements for different aspects of life. The main goal of IoT technologies is to simplify processes in different fields, to ensure a better efficiency of systems (technologies or specific processes) and finally to improve life quality. Sustainability has become a key issue for population where the dynamic development of IoT technologies is bringing different useful benefits, but this fast development must be carefully monitored and evaluated from an environmental point of view to limit the presence of harmful impacts and ensure the smart utilization of limited global resources. Significant research efforts are needed in the previous sense to carefully investigate the pros and cons of IoT technologies. This review editorial is partially directed on the research contributions presented at the 4th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies held in Split and Bol, Croatia, in 2019 (SpliTech 2019) as well as on recent findings from literature. The SpliTech2019 conference was a valuable event that successfully linked different engineering professions, industrial experts and finally researchers from academia. The focus of the conference was directed towards key conference tracks such as Smart City, Energy/Environment, e-Health and Engineering Modelling. The research presented and discussed at the SpliTech2019 conference helped to understand the complex and intertwined effects of IoT technologies on societies and their potential effects on sustainability in general. Various application areas of IoT technologies were discussed as well as the progress made. Four main topical areas were discussed in the herein editorial, i.e. latest advancements in the further fields: (i) IoT technologies in Sustainable Energy and Environment, (ii) IoT enabled Smart City, (iii) E-health - Ambient assisted living systems (iv) IoT technologies in Transportation and Low Carbon Products. The main outcomes of the review introductory article contributed to the better understanding of current technological progress in IoT application areas as well as the environmental implications linked with the increased application of IoT products.},

  abstract = {Countries are working into making agriculture more sustainable by integrating different technologies to enhance its operation. Implementing improvements in irrigation systems is crucial for the water-use efficiency and works as a contributor to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under the United Nations specifically Goal 6 and Target 6.4. This paper aims to highlight the contribution of SMART irrigation using Internet of Things (IoT) and sensory systems in relation to the SDGs. The study is based on a qualitative design along with focusing on secondary data collection method. Automated irrigation systems are essential for conservation of water, this improvement could have a vital role in minimizing water usage. Agriculture and farming techniques is also linked with IoT and automation, to make the whole processes much more effective and efficient. Sensory systems helped farmers better understand their crops and reduced the environmental impacts and conserve resources. Through these advanced systems effective soil and weather monitoring takes place along with efficient water management. Irrigation systems have been determined as positive contributor toward optimized irrigation systems that could enhance the use of continuous research and development which focus on enhancing the sustainable operations and cost reduction. Lastly, the challenges and benefits for the implementation of sensory based irrigation systems are discussed. This review will assist researchers and farmers to better understand irrigation techniques and provide an adequate approach would be sufficient to carry out irrigation related activities.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in smart sensing technologies have fostered the wide-spread utilization of smart city applications, which rely on Internet of Things (IoT) frameworks to work efficiently. The terms "smart city" and "IoT framework", however, have been given several definitions, without consensus. Consequently, definitions of the terms "smart city" and "IoT framework" need to be condensed, consolidating concepts and guidelines of smart cities and IoT frameworks, as will be shown in this study. In addition, a systematic survey of IoT frameworks for smart city applications is presented, summarizing and comparing the technologies and architectures of IoT frameworks for smart city applications. As a result of this study, trends in IoT frameworks for smart city applications and a definition of the term "smart city" are provided. Materializing the findings achieved in this study, an abstract IoT framework concept for smart city applications is proposed. It is expected that the definition of the term "smart city" may be used as a basis for a generally accepted formal definition and that the proposed IoT framework concept may provide a strong foundation for successful IoT framework implementations in the context of smart city applications.},

Cloud, being the crucial component of IoT, provides valuable application specific services in many application domains. A number of IoT cloud providers are currently emerging into the market to leverage suitable and specific IoT based services. In spite of huge possible involvement of these IoT clouds, no standard cum comparative analytical study has been found across the literature databases. This article surveys popular IoT cloud platforms in light of solving several service domains such as application development, device management, system management, heterogeneity management, data management, tools for analysis, deployment, monitoring, visualization, and research. A comparison is presented for overall dissemination of IoT clouds according to their applicability. Further, few challenges are also described that the researchers should take on in near future. Ultimately, the goal of this article is to provide detailed knowledge about the existing IoT cloud service providers and their pros and cons in concrete form.},

  abstract = {Smart city is an application of Internet of Things (IoT) notion. Unceasing growth of population and urbanization have intensified innovative ways to handle urbanization with minimal impact on environment, citizen lifestyles, and governance. Initial integration of information communication technology (ICT) into city operations have promoted telicity, information city, and digital city concepts. Later, the conception of IoT has founded the smart cities, which support the city operations intelligently with minimal human interaction. Smart city emerged as a solution to address the challenges arise with exponential growth of urbanization and population. However, smart city concept is still evolving and not mainstreamed throughout the globe due to technological, economical, and governing barriers. Therefore, this paper aims to deliver the essence of smart cities. The paper presents a brief overview of smart cities, followed by the features and characteristics, generic architecture, composition, and real-world implementations of smart cities. Finally, we present some challenges and opportunities identified through extensive literature survey on smart cities.},
