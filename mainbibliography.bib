@article{BIBRI2018230,
  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key components of the ICT infrastructure of smart sustainable cities as an emerging urban development approach due to its great potential to advance environmental sustainability. As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications.},

  abstract = {The rapid development and implementation of smart and IoT (Internet of Things) based technologies have allowed for various possibilities in technological advancements for different aspects of life. The main goal of IoT technologies is to simplify processes in different fields, to ensure a better efficiency of systems (technologies or specific processes) and finally to improve life quality. Sustainability has become a key issue for population where the dynamic development of IoT technologies is bringing different useful benefits, but this fast development must be carefully monitored and evaluated from an environmental point of view to limit the presence of harmful impacts and ensure the smart utilization of limited global resources. Significant research efforts are needed in the previous sense to carefully investigate the pros and cons of IoT technologies. This review editorial is partially directed on the research contributions presented at the 4th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies held in Split and Bol, Croatia, in 2019 (SpliTech 2019) as well as on recent findings from literature. The SpliTech2019 conference was a valuable event that successfully linked different engineering professions, industrial experts and finally researchers from academia. The focus of the conference was directed towards key conference tracks such as Smart City, Energy/Environment, e-Health and Engineering Modelling. The research presented and discussed at the SpliTech2019 conference helped to understand the complex and intertwined effects of IoT technologies on societies and their potential effects on sustainability in general. Various application areas of IoT technologies were discussed as well as the progress made. Four main topical areas were discussed in the herein editorial, i.e. latest advancements in the further fields: (i) IoT technologies in Sustainable Energy and Environment, (ii) IoT enabled Smart City, (iii) E-health – Ambient assisted living systems (iv) IoT technologies in Transportation and Low Carbon Products. The main outcomes of the review introductory article contributed to the better understanding of current technological progress in IoT application areas as well as the environmental implications linked with the increased application of IoT products.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in smart sensing technologies have fostered the wide-spread utilization of smart city applications, which rely on Internet of Things (IoT) frameworks to work efficiently. The terms "smart city" and "IoT framework", however, have been given several definitions, without consensus. Consequently, definitions of the terms "smart city" and "IoT framework" need to be condensed, consolidating concepts and guidelines of smart cities and IoT frameworks, as will be shown in this study. In addition, a systematic survey of IoT frameworks for smart city applications is presented, summarizing and comparing the technologies and architectures of IoT frameworks for smart city applications. As a result of this study, trends in IoT frameworks for smart city applications and a definition of the term "smart city" are provided. Materializing the findings achieved in this study, an abstract IoT framework concept for smart city applications is proposed. It is expected that the definition of the term "smart city" may be used as a basis for a generally accepted formal definition and that the proposed IoT framework concept may provide a strong foundation for successful IoT framework implementations in the context of smart city applications.},

Meanwhile, the field has scarcely adopted any engineering practices currently employed in other types of large-scale systems. Although many researchers and practitioners are aware of the current state of affairs and strive to address these problems, compromises have been hard to reach, making them settle for sub-optimal solutions. This paper surveys the current state of the art in designing and constructing IoT systems from the software engineering perspective, without overlooking hardware concerns, revealing current trends and research directions.},

  abstract = {Smart city is an application of Internet of Things (IoT) notion. Unceasing growth of population and urbanization have intensified innovative ways to handle urbanization with minimal impact on environment, citizen lifestyles, and governance. Initial integration of information communication technology (ICT) into city operations have promoted telicity, information city, and digital city concepts. Later, the conception of IoT has founded the smart cities, which support the city operations intelligently with minimal human interaction. Smart city emerged as a solution to address the challenges arise with exponential growth of urbanization and population. However, smart city concept is still evolving and not mainstreamed throughout the globe due to technological, economical, and governing barriers. Therefore, this paper aims to deliver the essence of smart cities. The paper presents a brief overview of smart cities, followed by the features and characteristics, generic architecture, composition, and real-world implementations of smart cities. Finally, we present some challenges and opportunities identified through extensive literature survey on smart cities.},
